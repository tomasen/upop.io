# The Unpopular Way

We believe the power of innovation. Our passion lies in crafting new solutions that solve problems and enrich people’s lives, especially in ways that enhance understanding between individuals and groups, grant access to resources, and remove barriers that limit opportunities.

#### Commitments and Approaches:

- **Innovation Over Conformity**: Prioritizing innovative approaches over conventional paths, daring to venture into less explored territories, willing to experiment and take the risks, we're committed to develop new ideas that may not be mainstream but have the potential to offer great improvements on life.
- **Differentiation**: Embracing the path less traveled not only sets our company apart from competitors but also serves as a reminder that we do not overlook opportunities due to short-sightedness, profit-driven thinking, or fear of the unknown.
- **Social and Technological Impact**: We are convinced that driving innovations will also foster a more inclusive and connected world. By harnessing the power of technology, we aim to break down echo chambers, give voice to silenced perspectives, and create opportunities for progress and growth.
- **Patience is a Virtue**: Pursuing innovative paths often requires a patient approach, as the benefits of progressive efforts usually take time to unfold. Adopting a long-term perspective and prioritizing lasting impact over immediate gains are the ways we choose to uphold our values and accomplish our goals.

We'll always be more inclined to choose the unpopular path. Not because it's easy, but because we prefer to carve our own way—not just following the herd, but forging our own journey, making our own decisions, and finding happiness in discovering things that others might overlook. We believe this is the truly efficient, dynamic way forward as a whole.

# Projects

Each project under [Unpopular Ideas LLC](https://upop.io) is a step towards a more informed and connected society and is designed with a commitment to creating meaningful, user-centric technology solutions. As we continue to innovate and expand, the goal remains to create technology that serves as a bridge to knowledge, empowerment, and positive change in society.

## VOTETRACK.US
 
[Votetrack.us](https://votetrack.us), initially named Project *K'iche'*, is designed to enhance transparency and accessibility in the legislative process by leveraging AI technology. Our aim is to make complex political information understandable and accessible for all citizens, including non-English speaking minority groups. The platform simplifies congressional votes, bills, amendments, and provides insightful analyses of representatives' voting records.

#### Key Features:

- **AI-Generated Summaries**: Our platform uses AI to provide clear, concise explanations of congressional votes and legislative documents, ensuring that users can easily grasp their significance without needing a background in law or politics.
- **Representative Voting Analysis**: We offer in-depth analysis of representatives' voting records, highlighting their alignment with party lines versus independent decision-making. This feature helps users assess the consistency and integrity of their elected officials.
- **Bill Version Tracking**: Our platform tracks changes across different versions of the same bill, presenting them in an easy-to-understand format. This allows users to follow the evolution of legislation and understand the implications of each amendment.
- **Clear Voting Visualization**: We provide a user-friendly interface that clearly displays voting patterns, showing how individual representatives or parties vote on specific issues. This feature enhances transparency and helps users make informed decisions.

By democratizing access to political information, Project *K'iche'* empowers citizens to actively participate in their governance, fostering a more informed and engaged electorate. We believe our solution aligns with Microsoft's commitment to leveraging technology for social impact and are seeking funding to further develop and scale our platform.
